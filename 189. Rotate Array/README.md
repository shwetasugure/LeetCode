##Purpose:
The code rotates an array to the right by a specified number of steps using in-place operations.

##Algorithm: 
It employs a three-step reversal algorithm -
 1. First, the entire array is reversed,
 2. Then the subarray before the rotation point is reversed.
 3. Then the subarray after the rotation point is reversed.

##Time Complexity: 
O(n), where n is the length of the array. The algorithm consists of three array reversal operations, each taking O(n/2) time, but constants are dropped, resulting in a linear time complexity.

##Space Complexity:
O(1). The rotations are performed in-place without using additional space that scales with the size of the input array.
