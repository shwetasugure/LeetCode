# Count Nice Pairs

Given an array `nums` of integers, a pair `(i, j)` is called nice if `i < j` and `nums[i] + reverse(nums[j]) == nums[j] + reverse(nums[i])`, where `reverse(x)` represents the reversed digits of `x`. Return the number of nice pairs.

## Solution Overview

The provided Java code defines a class with a method, `countNicePairs`, which calculates the number of nice pairs in the array.

### Algorithm:

1. Transform each element in the array by subtracting its reverse.
2. Sort the transformed array.
3. Iterate through the array, counting the occurrences of each unique element and calculating the number of pairs for each occurrence.
4. Sum the counts of nice pairs for each unique element.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array. The algorithm involves sorting the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
