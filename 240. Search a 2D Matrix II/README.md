# Search a 2D Matrix II
The code implements a search algorithm in a sorted 2D matrix where each row and column are sorted in ascending order. It uses a pointer-based approach to efficiently search for a target value.

## Initialization:
row is initialized to 0 (starting from the first row).
col is initialized to m-1 (starting from the last column).

## Search Loop:
- While the pointers are within the matrix boundaries (row < n and col >= 0):
- If the current matrix element equals the target, return true.
- If the current element is less than the target, move to the next row (row++).
- If the current element is greater than the target, move to the previous column (col--).

## Result:
If the loop completes without finding the target, return false.

## Time Complexity:
O(n + m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. The algorithm traverses at most n rows and m columns.

## Space Complexity:
O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
